OpenSlider XYZ is a motorized slider with multiple axis of rotation, built using common hardware and 3D printed components.

The goal of OpenSlider is to provide a robust, open source programmable slider platform to fill a variety of needs for hobbyists.

The slider is designed with ease of printing and assembly in mind. No support material is needed. PETG or ABS is recomended.
